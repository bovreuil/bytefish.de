## You should disable Indexes and MultiViews either here or in the
## global config. Symlinks maybe needed for URL rewriting.
Options -Indexes -MultiViews +FollowSymLinks
##
## Make sure nobody gets the htaccess files:
<Files ~ "^[\._]ht">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    Satisfy All
</Files>
##
## Set the 404 page:
ErrorDocument 404                   /404.html
##
## We want to rewrite, so all http:// traffic is directed to https://
RewriteEngine on

## Make sure we redirect all HTTP Traffic to HTTPS with a 301 Redirect,
## so Disable the Rewrite for HTTPS and rewrite all other incoming 
## requests:
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\. [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(?:www\.)?(.+)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^ https://www.%1%{REQUEST_URI} [L,NE,R=301]
