summary: On COVID-19 and personal hygiene.

Entire countries going on lockdown. Borders closed. The weakest of our societies 
suffering and health workers doing long shifts. COVID-19 took the world by storm. 
And what has once been a Hollywood disaster movie script turned into reality.

Everybody is an Epidemiologist at the moment... me included. And while we know 
everything about basic reproduction numbers, exponential growth, respirators 
and surgical masks... there is something simple we should all raise awareness 
for: 

* **Personal Hygiene**

The World Health Organization (WHO) has a list of advices all of us should follow:

## Wash your hands frequently ##

Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.

**Why?** Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that 
may be on your hands.

## Maintain social distancing ##

Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

**Why?** When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may 
contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person 
coughing has the disease.

## Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth ##

**Why?** Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus 
to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

## Practice respiratory hygiene ##

Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth 
and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue 
immediately.

**Why?** Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from 
viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

## If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early ##

Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and 
call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

**Why?** National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your 
area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health 
facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

## Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider ##

Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare provider, 
your national and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others 
from COVID-19.

**Why?** National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on whether COVID-19 is spreading 
in your area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
